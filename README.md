[Demo](https://volosh1n.github.io/reddit-fetch/)

A simple gallery of last posts from [/r/Delightfullychubby](https://www.reddit.com/r/Delightfullychubby/).

`const URL` contains path to subreddit's JSON.

App skips `v.redd.it`, YouTube and Imgur's `.gifv` video contents.

All of the images have full-size src-attribute.
